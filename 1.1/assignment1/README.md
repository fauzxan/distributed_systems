# How to run:
Run `go build` in the same level as `main.go`, then run `go run main.go`

## Modifiable sections:
In the main.go file, there are sections in the main() function demarcated as `START` and `END`. These sections are modifiable. In brief:
- You can set the number of clients
- You need to manually define which client sends message to which other client.
